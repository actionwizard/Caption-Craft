# Caption-Craft
Image Captioning using Deep Neural Networks

Generate accurate and natural captions for images by harnessing the power of Deep Neural Networks. This project seamlessly combines computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to craft authentic image descriptions.

## Project Overview

### Key Tasks:
- Feature extraction from images
- Object and scene analysis
- Advanced model design for caption generation

## Description

Caption Craft is a project dedicated to the art of generating lifelike captions for images using cutting-edge Deep Neural Networks. By combining computer vision and NLP techniques, we bring images to life with accurate and natural language descriptions.

## Tasks

Our project involves the following key tasks:

### Feature Extraction
- We extract essential features from images to provide context for the captions.

### Object and Scene Analysis
- We perform in-depth analysis of objects and scenes within the images, enabling a rich understanding of visual content.

### Model Design
- We design advanced neural network models that leverage the power of AI to generate captivating image captions.
